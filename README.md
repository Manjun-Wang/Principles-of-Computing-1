Principles-of-Computing
=======================

This is a repository for the course of Principles of Computing, which is part of computer science series offered by 
Rice University on Coursera.


This class covers a collection of principles that are fundamental to Computer Science. As a motivating application of 
these principles, it will examine a collection of strategy games and apply these principles in the analysis/solution of 
these games.

Each week, we will watch a set of 6-8 videos and then complete homework on the mathematical aspects of these concepts. Our main weekly task is to complete a mini-project that furthers your practical understanding of the material.

Below is the syllabus for the class.
